**Project Title: 2D Educational Game – Romanian Language**

**Description:**
I developed a 2D platformer video game for educational purposes, using the Unity game engine and the C# language. The project integrates classic game mechanics with didactic elements to facilitate Romanian language learning.

**Responsibilities and Technical Achievements:**

* **Architecture and Gameplay:** Implemented the player control system (movement, jump, physics-based interactions) and combat mechanics (health system, damage, knockback).
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Developed enemy behaviors (patrolling, player detection) using finite state machines.
* **Interactive Systems:** Integrated a complex dialogue system for NPC interaction and a UI system for displaying scores and health.
* **Optimization and Structure:** Utilized a modular code structure, separating input logic, movement, and game data (HealthMaster, ScoreKeeper).
